        <h3>CRUD Web Application</h3>
        <p>Developed a CRUD-based web application to manage academic data such as majors, students, lecturers, and academic records using PHP and MySQL. This project was a team effort with a focus on a clean interface, modular code structure, and secure database connections. Through this project, I honed my skills in backend development, database design, and team collaboration.</p>

        <h3>Trash Object Detection</h3>
        <p>Developed a real-time garbage classification system using TensorFlow and OpenCV. The system detects and classifies waste into six types—cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and trash—by combining a deep learning model with background subtraction and prediction buffering to enhance accuracy. Detection results are displayed live with labels and confidence scores.</p>

        <h3>Group Attendance Management</h3>
        <p>Developed an advanced face recognition time attendance system using Python, OpenCV, FaceNet, and MTCNN, integrated with a Tkinter-based GUI. This application with shift-based check-in/out, real-time face detection, and embedding-based recognition. Features include admin/user management, shift scheduling, attendance report, salary calculation, and attendance graphics.</p>

        <h3>Speech-to-Text Summarization</h3>
        <p>Allows users to record a live voice, convert it to text using Google Speech Recognition, and then perform TextRank-based summarization to summarize the voice content. Built using Python, NLTK, and Tkinter as the GUI, the app also presents a word count comparison between the original text and the summarized result in a visual form (bar graph). Key features include speech-to-text, text cleaning, tokenization, word frequency counting, and visualization of the summary results.</p>

        <h3>CT Scan Edge Detection</h3>
        <p>Applied spatial filtering to CT scan images to clarify structures and detect edges. The image is processed with Gaussian Blur to reduce noise, followed by Sobel operator to extract horizontal and vertical edges. The results are displayed as a three-panel visualization: the original image, the Gaussian filtering result, and the edge detection result using Sobel. This project is useful for understanding the initial stages of preprocessing in medical image analysis.</p>

        <h3>Image Alignment with ORB</h3>
        <p>Image matching and alignment using ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) to detect features between two object images. Images are matched with Brute-Force Matcher using Hamming distance, then Homography transformation is calculated using RANSAC method. Display the 50 best feature matches, calculate the inliers and outliers, generate an overlay image from the alignment results. This process is useful in applications such as image stitching and object tracking.</p>

        <h3>Doctor AI Mobile</h3>
        <p>developed DoctorAI, a mobile application that contains an AI-based chatbot to answer medical questions from users. The chatbot was initially developed using Python and then deployed to a Dart (Flutter) based mobile application. In addition to the chatbot, the app also provides a search feature for pharmacy and hospital addresses in various regions, as well as a drug recommendation feature for minor ailments. This project integrates artificial intelligence with digital health services to provide solutions that are informative, practical, and easily accessible to users.</p>
